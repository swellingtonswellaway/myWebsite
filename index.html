        <p>Hi I’m Alice. I am British and come from Dorset, a place famous for its Jurrasic Coast.<br>
        It's also a place where old people go to die so moving to Amsterdam at a young age was exactly<br> what I was looking for.<br>
        I totally fell in love with the place and have made it my home now.<br>
        Fingers crossed those nasty Brexiteers don’t ruin that for me!<br>
        I live in Amsterdam Oost and I love it. It’s becoming a very hip neighbourhood but I kind of like it as it is!</p>
        <p>I worked at Boom Chicago comedy theatre for about 10 years, as a waitress/bartender,<br>theatre manager and then I taught myself video editing and became a video editor there.<br>
        Since then I have done freelance editing work and was the kitchen manager at a pizza restaurant and lots of other hospitality jobs.<br> I am very new to coding, I've been toying with the idea for a few years but was very confused as to where to start.<br> I am very excited and happy to have been accepted into this course. <br>This homework was a good challenge, it took me down some coding &apos;rabbit holes&apos; and I started to confuse <br>myself but I came out the other end unschathed and with more knowledge than I had before! </p>

        <img class="img"id="cat" src="images/sacha-cat.jpg" alt="A picture of my cat Sacha.">
        <p>This little darling is 20.5 years old.  In 1/2 a year she will be the equivalent of 100 human years old. <br> Her name is Sacha and she deserves a mention, not only because I need to justify having a navigation bar to <br>direct you to different sections of my very small website and an opportunity for an unordered list!<br>
        She is my little baby and she is perhaps the grumpiest cat you will ever meet!<br>
        <p><b>Her favourite things are:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sleeping.</li>
        <li>Eating.</li>
        <li>Cuddles.</li>
        <li>Catnip.</li>
        <li>Pretending that she is dead in various positions around my house.</li>
        <li>Chasing invisible flies.</li>
        <li>Meowing at 4am for no apparent reason.</li>
    </ul>
        <p>Disclosure: Picture taken when she was just a young 19!</p>
